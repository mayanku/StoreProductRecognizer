# StoreProductRecognizer
<center><h2> ABSTRACT </h2></center>
<p>Grocery item image classification is a well-researched problem. However, until the recent announcements form Amazon regarding their “Just walk out” technology used in Amazon Go, most Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques used in the state-of-the-art research did not involve neural network</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to recognize products in a store shelves using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). This helps to provide more accuracy in categorizing the products to help the owners to avoid problems like product misplacement, product availability in the shelves. The results of the detection are stored in a database to make in much easier and faster to process this information later in order to create a custom service as required by the owners.</p>
